### About Me
I'm a geek from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I'm a father to two boys. I love technology, [but not as much as you, you see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERCzN91JicA). I'm really into hockey, especially fantasy hockey and the Flames. I'd probably beat you in a hockey pool (sorry). I'm terrible at actually playing hockey though. I love music (indie/alternative) and I go to a **lot** of concerts, or at least I used to before COVID-19. I'm also really into restaurants, or at least I used to be before having kids. I made iOS app versions of Calgary restaurant critic John Gilchrist's books, but people aren't willing to pay the same money for an app as a book. :(
